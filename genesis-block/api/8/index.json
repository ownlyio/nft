    "description": "“.. and the creation of two forces that will shepherd all that was, that is, and that will be.” The seventh and eighth piece of the ‘Genesis Block’ collection can be viewed as twins; two forces that are intertwined. Marso portrays this in the form of man and woman and mixes the subject with her own vibrant art style giving a fresh look at the core concept of Immersion and integration that goes hand-in-hand with user adaptation and experience.",
