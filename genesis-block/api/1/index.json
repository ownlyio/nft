    "name": "Marso #1 of 1: Day 1 Creation (Let There Be Light)",
    "description": "“In the beginning, there was only darkness. A formless and desolate void. From it, voice whispered: ‘Let there be light’.” Creation is the first art piece from Marso’s ‘Genesis Block’ collection wherein it tells the story of how the ‘blockchain’ came into fruition. Integrating the core concept of a disseminated network that comprises computer systems or blocks, Marso pulls the viewer of the artwork into a trance-like state by showing a captivating take on the birth of the digital era, a la ‘digital renaissance’. Through artwork shows the viewers how blockchains work by using geometrical shapes and the hand as a subject while giving it the eye candy treatment Marso is known for. A piece worthy of the phrase: ‘let there be light’.",
