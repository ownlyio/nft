    "description": "“Let there be dry land, bountiful waters, and nurturing vegetation.” What comes after expansion and division? Progress and innovation. The third piece in the ‘Genesis Block’ collection by Marso highlights the idea of growth, creativity, and breaking out. Taking the symbolism of growth into upward arrows and vegetations, this piece gives off a sense of purpose and passion to the viewer with the main subject being a plant that blooms in the right kind of environment, a sentiment that can be seen throughout the various blockchain platforms and communities.",
