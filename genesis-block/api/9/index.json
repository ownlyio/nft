    "description": "“.. once every creation was complete, everything was put in a place.” The final piece for the “Genesis” collection by Marso triumphs the one place wherein all blockchain-related actions would build up to: Metaverse. As depicted in the art piece, it is a place wherein everyone and everything that is imaginable and thinkable will take place such as NFTs, Smart Contracts / Policy IDs, Cryptocurrency, Digital Culture, and the like. Rightfully placed in the center of the collection, Eden can be seen as the next goal for the trajectory of the blockchain force and all that follows. A culmination of all that came before, Eden shows the future of blockchain (if not the current state).",
