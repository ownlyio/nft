    "name": "Marso #1 of 1: Day 6: Community (An Ecosystem of Belongingness)",
    "description": "“.. let there be of every species and race imaginable, for there is belongingness for everything.” With the sixth piece, Marso tackles the idea of ‘community’ or ‘ecosystem’.; a sense of kinship, a nurturing environment, and a strong social bond across all blockchain platforms and users. From developers to investors, there would always be a common denominator: connected. This is highly emphasized in the art piece through the use of symbols such as the valley, the trees, and the surrounding animals. Looking at the art piece, one would feel the sense of discovering a place that one would call home.",
