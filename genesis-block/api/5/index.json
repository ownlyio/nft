    "description": "“.. blessing them to multiply and fill the waters and the sky with life.” The fifth art piece of Marso in her ‘Genesis Block’ collection presents her interpretation of the early adapters’ experience of glee, ecstasy, and pure bliss when it comes to seeing their dreams for the blockchain becoming a reality. With the sun, moon, blocks, and keys as symbols, Marso gives the viewers of the artwork an otherworldly experience through her mix of art style and visual storytelling as depicted in this piece.",
