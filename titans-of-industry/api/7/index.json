    "name": "THE BENEVOLENT AMBASSADOR",
    "description": "In 2019, Sam Backman-Fried gave a gift to the world — a crypto derivatives exchange called FTX. In just a year, his crypto company made $85 million in fee revenues. Yet what’s more admirable in him is his generosity. This titan knows how to give back, allotting 1% of FTX’s net fees to be given to the world’s most effective charities! Surely, he is the Benevolent Ambassador that we call him.",
