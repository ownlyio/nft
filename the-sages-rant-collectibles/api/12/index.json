    "description": "Grass Grin Maze evolved from the knot gardens of Southern MustachioVerse and was first constructed during the mid-16th century. As detailed in The Sages Rant Book 1 Chapter 3: Red, White, and Blue, this maze was constructed from evergreen herbs, but, over time, the maze was covered by rare-robust growing Kunai grass. Initially, the maze was not intended to confuse Mustachios, but to provide a walking path. However, a mischievous Mustachio was disowned by his royal family, and he cursed this placeâ€”the start of unending obstacles and notorious sightings of apparitions.",
