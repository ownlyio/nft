    "description": "The Robe of Protection is a special protective barberâ€™s cloth-like robe with waterproof and dustproof features. As outlined in The Sages Rant Book 1 Chapter 6: The Chaos by the Tavern, Mustachios who own this can be protected from the changing-harshed environment. Mustachio may feel itchy if they fail to wash the robe. Note! This will not protect the Mustachios from ballistics. Brazing the Winter Season, the Mustachios found this through the traveling Merchant at the Whiskers Village.",
