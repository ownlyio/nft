    "name": "Chumpy Buttons",
    "description": "He was once pegged to be the next Master Chef Gordon, minus the grumpy and hyper attitude. His staff loves him given his friendliness and laid-back demeanor - there is ‘no heat’ in the kitchen. Well-known food critics have recognized Buttons as one of the world’s excellent chefs. His favorite food, surprisingly - is gummy bears.",
