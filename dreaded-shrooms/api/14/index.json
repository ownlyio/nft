    "description": "After the Pharaoh's passing, Oyshepsut takes over the kingdom and immediately ended slavery. The nation has been living harmoniously, with her strong leadership and fair judgement - uniting with other countries to help find answers to famine and drought. In her spare time, the Queen enjoys bubble baths, drinking wine, and sunset viewing from her great pyramids.",
