    "name": "Juancho",
    "description": "A very friendly guy and a familiar face in the neighborhood. He’s now in his 40s living with his mom. Not completely a BUM since he works part time doing the neighbors lawn and pool once in a while. Juancho loves hanging out with younger friends, often takes out lotsa fast food rather than booze - one of the best decisions he makes everyday. Hip-hop x Latin music is his jam, and would instantly ‘crip walks’ his way to the tunes and dance his heart out.",
