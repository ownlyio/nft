    "description": "A sweet soft spoken busboy/cook in a local diner in Kauai by day. When night time comes, Melehune is a crowd-darling star when he plays his songs at a bar & grill owned by his good friends. Surely a gentle giant with the voice of an angel! He spends his days off by the beach with a couple of six-packs, ukulele, and boogie board.",
