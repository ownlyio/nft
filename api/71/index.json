    "description": "Mermain is a creature born in the depths of the sea. While roaming around the ocean floor one day, he discovered a capsized submarine filled with people who are barely alive due to being stuck underwater for more than a week with not enough food. When they saw him, instead of being afraid, they treated him as a friend. He tried to meet them up close and personal by opening the submarine door.",
