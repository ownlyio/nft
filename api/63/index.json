    "description": "All Boxheads are born with a soft glowing skull. Nobody knows why the creator thought that was a good idea, tho. At an early age, they are taught to create clay pots and bricks and when they reach adulthood, they would build a cube shaped oven-like brick structure which they would use as a helmet for their skull to protect it from being accidentally squished.",
