    "description": "If there was anyone in this group closest to actually thinking like a human, it's Octobass.Â  She loves music, dreams of becoming a dj, but spends most of her adult life working her ass off just to pay the bills. She regrets offering her company to do extra work after realizing more arms doesnt necessarily mean she can do things faster than everyone else, it actually meant there will be more work directed at her in her day job.",
