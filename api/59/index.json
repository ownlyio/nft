    "description": "Puffy is a dog-like character made out of soft solid cloud. Although she can float like a puff of cloud anytime she wants to, she prefers long walks and is always excited to play fetch. She is the perfect cuddle buddy but when she turns grayish in color 7 consecutive days a month, it's advisable to leave her outdoors. She is known to wet the bed like a thunderstorm does when you accidentally left a window beside your bed open.",
