    "description": "Exo is an entity made out of pure radioactive nuclear energy. She didn't use to have a physical body but after being able to warp herself through different worlds, she learned ways on how she could manipulate the energy and build herself a body. Her head on the other hand is too difficult to convert so she just made a forcefield to contain the energy and keep it intact.",
